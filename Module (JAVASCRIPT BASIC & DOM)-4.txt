            Ans: JavaScript is the Programming Language for the Web.
                          JavaScript can-update and change both HTML and CSS.
                          JavaScript can calculate, manipulate and validate data.


           2.	What is the use of isNaN function?
           Ans: The JavaScript isNaN() function is used to check whether a given is an illegal number
                     or not.
                          It returns true if the value is a NaN else returns false.


           3.	What is negative infinity?
           Ans: Number .NEGATIVE_INFINITY IS a special numeric value that  is returned when
                    an arithmetic operation or mathematical function generates a negative value greater than the largest                    
                    representable number in JavaScript.


           4.	Which company developed JavaScript?
           Ans: JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed 
                    for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA the mozilla foundation continued to develop 
                    JavaScript for the Firefox browser.


         5.	What are undeclared and undefined variables?
         Ans: Undefined: it occurs when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any 
                   value. Undefined is not a keyword.

                  Undeclared: it occurs when we try to access any variable that is not initialized or 
                  declared earlier using the var or const keyword.



             6.	Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?
            Ans:  Syntax: 
                       document.createElement(“<tagName>”);
                       // where <tagName> can be any HTML
                      // tagName like div, ul, button etc;
                     // newDiv element has been created 

                       For eg: let newDiv = document.createElement(“div”);


             7.	What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?
            Ans: ViewState: It is maintained at only one level that is page-level. Changes made on a
                      single page is not visible on other pages.

                       	Information that gathered in ViewState is stored for the clients only and cannot be transferred to any other place.

                       SessionState: It is maintained at session-level and data can be accessed across all pages in the web application.
                       Information is stored within the server and can be accessed by any person that has access to the sever where 
                       the information is stored.


             8.	What is === operator?
             Ans: Strict equality (===):

                         	The strict equality (===) operator checks whether its two operands are equal, 
                                     returning a Boolean result. Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always  
                                     considers operands of different types to be different.


              9.	How can the style/class of an element be changed in JavaScript?
              Ans: There are two ways to change Style/class of an element…

                              1.	Changing css with style properties:-
                                    Syntax: document.getElementById(“id”).style.property = new.style

                              2.	Changing class itself:-  here we can use two properties that can manipulate the classes.
                                           a.  ClassList property:- 
                                                  Syntax: document.getElementById(“id”).classList
	                                      Here we can use add(), remove(), toggle() method to manipulate the classes

                                           b.	 The className Property:- 
                                                  Syntax: document.getElementById(“id”).className = class
	                                      This property is used to set the current class of the element to the specified class.



                  10.	 How to read and write a file using JavaScript?
                  Ans: The fs.readFile() and rs.writeFile() methods are used to read and write of a file using
                            JavaScript. The file is read using the fs.readFile() function, which is an inbuilt method. This     
                            technique reads the full file into memory and stores it in a buffer.


                 11.	   What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?
                 Ans: JavaScript supports five different types of loops:
                             	While: loops though a block of code as long as the condition specified evaluates to true.
                             	Do-while: loops through a block of code once. Then the condition is evaluated. If the
                                     condition is true the statement is repeated as long as the specified condition is true.
                             	For: loops through a block of code until the counter reaches a specified number.
                             	For-in: loops through the properties of an object.
                             	For-of: loops over iterable objects such as arrays strings etc


                   12.	How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?
                   Ans: Given a string containing an integer value and along with that user passes a base value.
                                	We need to convert that string of any base value to an integer in JavaScript.
                                	For performing the above-illustrated task, we would be using a method provided 
                                    by JavaScript called as parseInt().


                    13.	What is the function of the delete operator?
                    Ans: The delete operator removes a property from an object. If the property’s value is an object
                              and there are no more references to the object, the object held by that property is                                      
                              eventually released automatically


                     14.	What are all the types of POP-UP boxes available in JavaScript?
                     Ans: In JavaScript, popup boxes are used to display the message or notification to the user. 
                                         There are three types of pop-up boxes in JavaScript namely Alert Box, 
                                             Confirm Box and Prompt Box.


                   15.	What is use of void (0)?
                   Ans: Void (0) means return undefined as a primitive value. We use this to prevent any 
                             negative effects on a webpage when we insert some expression


                   16.	How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?
                   Ans: We can use window.location property inside the script tag to forcefully load another 
                            page in JavaScript. It is a reference to a location object that is it represents the 
                            current location of the document we can change the URL of a window by accessing it.

                          Syntax:
                                   <script>
	                                Window.location = <path / URL>
                                    </script>



               17.	What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?
               Ans: Disadvantages of using innerHTML property in JavaScript:
                                    The use of innerHTML very slow.
                            	Preserves event handlers attached to any DOM elements.
                            	Content is replaced everywhere.
                            	Appending to innerHTML is not supported.
                            	Old content replaced issue.
                            	Can also be used for cross-site scripting.
